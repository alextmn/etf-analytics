    <h4>The assets below show signals strength, which usually oscillates in the range [-1;+1] when the market is in regular conditions. When the signal is below -1 or above +1 the market is considered to be overbought and oversold respectfully.</h4>
    <h4>We calculate the asset-cash ratio which represents the risk. When the signal is 0, meaning the market is regular (flat) then the ratio is 100% (100% - asset, 0% - cash). When the signal is for example +1, indicating the market is overbought  then the ratio could be 90% (90% - asset, 10% - cash). When the signal is for example -1, indicating the market is oversold then the ratio could be 110% (100% - asset, 10% - cash to be borrowed). </h4>
