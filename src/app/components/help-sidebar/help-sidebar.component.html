    <h2>📈 What Does the Signal Mean?</h2>
    <p>
      Each ETF is analyzed daily using probabilistic programming, a smart AI technique that looks at past price behavior 
      and market trends to estimate whether an asset is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cheap</strong> (💸 signal < 0) — potentially undervalued</li>
      <li><strong>Expensive</strong> (💰 signal > 0) — possibly overbought</li>
      <li><strong>Neutral</strong> (⚖️ signal ≈ 0) — fairly priced</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Signal is shown on a z-score scale — similar to how weather forecasts use percentages to show probability. 
      Most values are between -1 and +1, but during volatile conditions, the signal can spike higher or lower.
    </p>

    <h2>🧮 What Should You Do?</h2>
    <p>
      💡 The signal automatically adjusts the Asset/Cash Ratio, telling you how much of your portfolio to invest in that ETF:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Signal 0 → 100% asset (neutral market)</li>
      <li>Signal -1 → ~110% asset (buy more, even borrow)</li>
      <li>Signal +1 → ~90% asset (reduce exposure, hold more cash)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="highlight">We do the math for you. ✅</p>

    <h2>➕ Add to Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      Click "Add to Portfolio" to use the signal and get your personalized allocation percentage. 
      This helps you build a diversified, dynamic ETF portfolio managed by smart analytics.
